By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author\u0027s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License.

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright ® 2002 Affero Inc.\n\n510 Third Street - Suite 225, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA\n\nThis license is a modified version of the GNU General Public License copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. made with their permission. Section 2(d) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This Public License applies to most of Affero\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Affero software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. This General Public License is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author\u0027s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Affero General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made

By contrast, our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nDevelopers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nA secondary benefit of defending all users\u0027 freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate. Many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about. The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public.\n\nThe GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community. It requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server. Therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version.\n\nAn older license, called the Affero General Public License and published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals. This is a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under this license.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other a

NOTE: This License is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care.\n\nAladdin Enterprises hereby grants to anyone the permission to apply this License to their own work, as long as the entire License (including the above notices and this paragraph) is copied with no changes, additions, or deletions except for changing the first paragraph of Section 0 to include a suitable description of the work to which the license is being applied and of the person or entity that holds the copyright in the work, and, if the License is being applied to a work created in a country other than the United States, replacing the first paragraph of Section 6 with an appropriate reference to the laws of the appropriate country.\n\n   0. Subject Matter\n\n   This License applies to the computer program known as \"Aladdin Ghostscript.\" The \"Program\", below, refers to such program. The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Aladdin Enterprises (the \"Licensor\"). Please note that Aladdin Ghostscript is neither the program known as \"GNU Ghostscript\" nor the version of Ghostscript available for commercial licensing from Artifex Software Inc.\n\n   A \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a translation or a modification.\n\n   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.\n\n   1. Licenses.\n\n   Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:\n\n      (a) You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program\u0027s source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n      (b) You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n   2. Restrictions.\n\n   This license is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n      (a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction:\n\n         (i) Posting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as an on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program is available independent of any other product or service. An example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that is operated by a company and t

(You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\n      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n\n      c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThis license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.\n\nYou are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.\n\nDefinitions\n\n   \n\n   \"Copyright Holder\" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.\n\n   \n\n   \"Contributor\" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder\u0027s procedures.\n\n   \n\n   \"You\" and \"your\" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.\n\n   \n\n   \"Package\" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.\n\n   \n\n   \"Distribute\" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.\n\n   \n\n   \"Distributor Fee\" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing fees.\n\n   \n\n   \"Standard Version\" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n\n   \n\n   \"Modified Version\" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.\n\n   \n\n   \"Original License\" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Perl Foundation in the future.\n\n   \n\n   \"Source\" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.\n\n   \n\n   \"Compiled\" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.\n\nPermission for Use and Modification Without Distribution\n\n   (1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.\n\nPermissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version\n\n   (2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.\n\n   (3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.\n\nDistribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source\n\n   (4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and p

Note, however, that you may not misappropriate the DOC software code, such as copyrighting it yourself or claiming authorship of the DOC software code, in a way that will prevent DOC software from being distributed freely using an open-source development model. You needn\u0027t inform anyone that you\u0027re using DOC software in your software, though we encourage you to let us know so we can promote your project in the DOC software success stories.\n\nThe ACE, TAO, CIAO, DAnCE, and CoSMIC web sites are maintained by the DOC Group at the Institute for Software Integrated Systems (ISIS) and the Center for Distributed Object Computing of Washington University, St. Louis for the development of open-source software as part of the open-source software community.

A number of companies around the world provide commercial support for DOC software, however. DOC software is Y2K-compliant, as long as the underlying OS platform is Y2K-compliant. Likewise, DOC software is compliant with the new US daylight savings rule passed by Congress as \"The Energy Policy Act of 2005,\" which established new daylight savings times (DST) rules for the United States that expand DST as of March 2007.

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.\n\nThis license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\nThis license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n   o We don\u0027t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is\u0027 distribution)\n\n   o You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free\u0027 usage)\n\n   o You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (`credits\u0027)\n\nWe specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\nFinally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text:\n\n\"\"\" Portions of this software are copyright ® \u003cyear\u003e The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. \"\"\"\n\nPlease replace \u003cyear\u003e with the value from the FreeType version you actually use.\n\nLegal Terms\n\n   0. Definitions\n\n   Throughout this license, the terms `package\u0027, `FreeType Project\u0027, and `FreeType archive\u0027 refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project\u0027, be they named as alpha, beta or final release.\n\n   `You\u0027 refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where `using\u0027 is a generic term including compiling the project\u0027s source code as well as linking it to form a `program\u0027 or `executable\u0027. This program is referred to as `a program using the FreeType engine\u0027.\n\n   This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this.\n\n   The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below.\n\n   1. No Warranty\n\n   THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED `AS IS\u0027 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\n\n   2. Redistribution\n\n   This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions:\n\n      o Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (

PREAMBLE\n\n   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.\n\n   This License is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.\n\n   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.\n\n   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS\n\n   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The \"Document\", below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   A \"Modified Version\" of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n\n   A \"Secondary Section\" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u0027s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.\n\n   The \"Invariant Sections\" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\n\n   The \"Cover Texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.\n\n   A \"Transparent\" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not \"Transparent\" is called \"Opaque\".\n\n   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \n\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation\u0027s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author\u0027s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program\u0027s source code as yo

Copyright (C) 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. \u003chttp://fsf.org/\u003e\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis GCC Runtime Library Exception (\"Exception\") is an additional permission under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 (\"GPLv3\"). It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",

It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor\u0027s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\u0027 reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\u0027s free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don\u0027t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary Ge

It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\u0027s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser Gen

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright 1998, Net Boolean Incorporated, Redwood City, California, USA All Rights Reserved. Note: This license is derived from the \"Artistic License\" as distributed with the Perl Programming Language. Its terms are different from those of the \"Artistic License.\"\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThe intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you\u0027re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.\n\n      b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.\n\n      c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:\n\n      a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.\n\n      c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.\n\n      d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.\n\n   5.

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright 1989 M. Stephenson)\n\n(Based on the BISON general public license, copyright 1988 Richard M. Stallman)\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license, but changing it is not allowed. You can also use this wording to make the terms for other programs.\n\nThe license agreements of most software companies keep you at the mercy of those companies. By contrast, our general public license is intended to give everyone the right to share NetHack. To make sure that you get the rights we want you to have, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. Hence this license agreement.\n\nSpecifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give away copies of NetHack, that you receive source code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change NetHack or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to deprive anyone else of these rights. For example, if you distribute copies of NetHack, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them their rights.\n\nAlso, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds out that there is no warranty for NetHack. If NetHack is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed.\n\nTherefore we (Mike Stephenson and other holders of NetHack copyrights) make the following terms which say what you must do to be allowed to distribute or change NetHack.\n\nCOPYING POLICIES\n\n   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of NetHack source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you keep intact the notices on all files that refer to copyrights, to this License Agreement, and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the NetHack program a copy of this License Agreement along with the program.\n\n   2. You may modify your copy or copies of NetHack or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above (including distributing this License Agreement), provided that you also do the following:\n\n      a) cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; and\n\n      b) cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is a derivative of NetHack or any part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this License Agreement (except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option)\n\n      c) You may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n   3. You may copy and distribute NetHack (or a portion or derivative of it, under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) accompany it with the complete machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or,\n\n      b) accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine-readable source code from an appropriate archive site. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution.)\n\n   For these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally released over Usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code or executable.\n\n   4. You may not copy, sublicense, distribute or transfer NetHack except as expressly provided under this License Agreement. Any attempt otherwise to copy, sublicense, distribute

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.\n\nTesting is essential for proper development and maintenance of standards-based products.\n\nFor buyers: adequate conformance testing leads to reduced integration costs and protection of investments in applications, software and people.\n\nFor software developers: conformance testing of platforms and middleware greatly reduces the cost of developing and maintaining multi-platform application software.\n\nFor suppliers: In-depth testing increases customer satisfaction and keeps development and support costs in check. API conformance is highly measurable and suppliers who claim it must be able to substantiate that claim.\n\nAs such, since these are benchmark measures of conformance, we feel the integrity of test tools is of importance. In order to preserve the integrity of the existing conformance modes of this test package and to permit recipients of modified versions of this package to run the original test modes, this license requires that the original test modes be preserved.\n\nIf you find a bug in one of the standards mode test cases, please let us know so we can feed this back into the original, and also raise any specification issues with the appropriate bodies (for example the POSIX committees).\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Package\" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through textual modification.\n\n\"Standard Version\" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.\n\n\"Copyright Holder\" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.\n\n\"You\" is you, if you\u0027re thinking about copying or distributing this Package.\n\n\"Reasonable copying fee\" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)\n\n\"Freely Available\" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.\n\n   1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.\n\n   2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.\n\n   3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least the following:\n\n   rename any non-standard executables and testcases so the names do not conflict with standard executables and testcases, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable and testcase that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.\n\n   4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you do at least the following:\n\n   accompany any non-standard executables and testcases with their corresponding Standard Version executables and testcases, giving the non-standard executables and testcases non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in man

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of \"intellectual property\", is inherently national law. This means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other IP rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world. This is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection. The internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community. Because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims. It then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims.\n\nThe purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain. Unlike licences for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licences, rightsholders will not be able to \"dual license\" their work by releasing the same work under different licences. This is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose. Rightsholders therefore can\u0027t re-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license. Doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts.\n\nThis document can cover either or both of the database and its contents (the data). Because databases can have a wide variety of content - not just factual data - rightsholders should use the Open Data Commons - Public Domain Dedication \u0026 Licence for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document. Because even factual data can sometimes have int

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright (C) 2001-2007 Technical Pursuit Inc., All Rights Reserved.\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nThe Reciprocal Public License (RPL) is based on the concept of reciprocity or, if you prefer, fairness.\n\nIn short, this license grew out of a desire to close loopholes in previous open source licenses, loopholes that allowed parties to acquire open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them. This occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a \"third party\".\n\nWhile there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the RPL as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular. After all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base.\n\nWhile you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the RPL is found in two definitions: \"Deploy\" and \"Required Components\".\n\nRegarding deployment, under the RPL your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc. must be made available to the open source community at large when you Deploy in any form -- either internally or to an outside party. Once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software.\n\nFurther, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they\u0027re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it.\n\nIn addition to these goals, the RPL was authored to meet the requirements of the Open Source Definition as maintained by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).\n\nThe specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document.\n\nLICENSE TERMS\n\n   1.0 General; Applicability \u0026 Definitions. This Reciprocal Public License Version 1.5 (\"License\") applies to any programs or other works as well as any and all updates or maintenance releases of said programs or works (\"Software\") not already covered by this License which the Software copyright holder (\"Licensor\") makes available containing a License Notice (hereinafter defined) from the Licensor specifying or allowing use or distribution under the terms of this License. As used in this License:\n\n      1.1 \"Contributor\" means any person or entity who created or contributed to the creation of an Extension.\n\n      1.2 \"Deploy\" means to use, Serve, sublicense or distribute Licensed Software other than for Your internal Research and/or Personal Use, and includes without limitation, any and all internal use or distribution of Licensed Software within Your business or organization other than for Research and/or Personal Use, as well as direct or indirect sublicensing or distribution of Licensed Software by You to any third party in any form or manner.\n\n      1.3 \"Derivative Works\" as used in this License is defined under U.S. copyright law.\n\n      1.4 \"Electronic Distribution Mechanism\" means a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data such as download from an FTP server or web site, where such mechanism is publicly accessible.\n\n      1.5 \"Extensions\" means any Modifications, Derivative Works, or Required Components as those terms are defined in this License.\n\n      1.6 \"License\" means this Reciprocal Public License.\n\n      1.7 \"License Notice\" means any notice contained in EXHIBIT A.\n\n      1.8 \"Licensed Software\" means any Software licensed pursuant to this License.

As far as I know, all included source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most restrictive); see below for details.\n\n[However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e.,\n\n   - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library\n\n   - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated\n\n   - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library\n\n   - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL\n\n   - Zlib is now external, in a library\n\n   - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included\n\n   - TSS has been removed\n\n   - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library\n\n   - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL\n\n   - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library\n\n[The licence continues]\n\nNote that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide. More information can be found e.g. at \"http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto\".\n\nThe legal status of this program is some combination of all these permissions and restrictions. Use only at your own responsibility. You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\nBECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright ® 2018 MongoDB, Inc.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   \"This License\" refers to Server Side Public License.\n\n   \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n   \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n   To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n   A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.\n\n   To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n   To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n   An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n   1. Source Code.\n\n   The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of a work.\n\n   A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n   The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A \"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n   The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work\u0027s System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow b

FileCopyrightText: <text>Copyright 2007 TAPR - http://www.tapr.org/OHL\n\nPREAMBLE\n\nOpen Hardware is a thing - a physical artifact, either electrical or mechanical - whose design information is available to, and usable by, the public in a way that allows anyone to make, modify, distribute, and use that thing. In this preface, design information is called \"documentation\" and things created from it are called \"products.\"\n\nThe TAPR Open Hardware License (\"OHL\") agreement provides a legal framework for Open Hardware projects. It may be used for any kind of product, be it a hammer or a computer motherboard, and is TAPR\u0027s contribution to the community; anyone may use the OHL for their Open Hardware project.\n\nLike the GNU General Public License, the OHL is designed to guarantee your freedom to share and to create. It forbids anyone who receives rights under the OHL to deny any other licensee those same rights to copy, modify, and distribute documentation, and to make, use and distribute products based on that documentation.\n\nUnlike the GPL, the OHL is not primarily a copyright license. While copyright protects documentation from unauthorized copying, modification, and distribution, it has little to do with your right to make, distribute, or use a product based on that documentation. For better or worse, patents play a significant role in those activities. Although it does not prohibit anyone from patenting inventions embodied in an Open Hardware design, and of course cannot prevent a third party from enforcing their patent rights, those who benefit from an OHL design may not bring lawsuits claiming that design infringes their patents or other intellectual property.\n\nThe OHL addresses unique issues involved in the creation of tangible, physical things, but does not cover software, firmware, or code loaded into programmable devices. A copyright-oriented license such as the GPL better suits these creations.\n\nHow can you use the OHL, or a design based upon it? While the terms and conditions below take precedence over this preamble, here is a summary:\n\n   * You may modify the documentation and make products based upon it.\n\n   * You may use products for any legal purpose without limitation.\n\n   * You may distribute unmodified documentation, but you must include the complete package as you received it.\n\n   * You may distribute products you make to third parties, if you either include the documentation on which the product is based, or make it available without charge for at least three years to anyone who requests it.\n\n   * You may distribute modified documentation or products based on it, if you:\n\n      * License your modifications under the OHL.\n\n      * Include those modifications, following the requirements stated below.\n\n      * Attempt to send the modified documentation by email to any of the developers who have provided their email address. This is a good faith obligation - if the email fails, you need do nothing more and may go on with your distribution.\n\n   * If you create a design that you want to license under the OHL, you should:\n\n      * Include this document in a file named LICENSE (with the appropriate extension) that is included in the documentation package.\n\n      * If the file format allows, include a notice like \"Licensed under the TAPR Open Hardware License (www.tapr.org/OHL)\" in each documentation file. While not required, you should also include this notice on printed circuit board artwork and the product itself; if space is limited the notice can be shortened or abbreviated.\n\n      * Include a copyright notice in each file and on printed circuit board artwork.\n\n      * If you wish to be notified of modifications that others may make, include your email address in a file named \"CONTRIB.TXT\" or something similar.\n\n   * Any time the OHL requires you to make documentation available to others, you must include all the materials you received from the upstream licensors.

For the purposes of this Agreement, any change to, addition to, or abridgement of the Software made by You is a \"Modification;\" however, any file You add to the Software that does not contain any part of the Software is not a \"Modification.\"\n\n      1.2 - If You are an individual acting on behalf of a corporation or other entity, Your use of the Software or any Modification is subject to Your having the authority to bind such corporation or entity to this Agreement. Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n      1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.\n\n      1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.\n\n      1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n   2. Support\n\n   Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the Software.\n\n   3. Intellectual Property Rights\n\n      3.1 - Except for the license expressly granted under copyright in Section 1.1, no rights, licenses or forbearances are granted or may arise in relation to this Agreement whether expressly, by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.

Providing copies to persons within such corporation or entity is not considered distribution for purposes of this Agreement.\n\n      1.3 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in source code format, You must do so only under the terms of this Agreement, and You must include a complete copy of this Agreement with Your distribution. With respect to any Modification You distribute in source code format, the terms of this Agreement will apply to You in the same way those terms apply to Yahoo! with respect to the Software. In other words, when You are distributing Modifications under this Agreement, You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo! in terms of the rights You grant and how the terms and conditions apply to You and the licensees of Your Modifications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when You \"stand in the shoes\" of Yahoo!, You are not subject to the jurisdiction provision under Section 7, which requires all disputes under this Agreement to be subject to the jurisdiction of federal or state courts of northern California.\n\n      1.4 - For the Software or any Modification You distribute in compiled or object code format, You must also provide recipients with access to the Software or Modification in source code format along with a complete copy of this Agreement. The distribution of the Software or Modifications in compiled or object code format may be under a license of Your choice, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, You must make absolutely clear that any license terms applying to such Software or Modification that differ from this Agreement are offered by You alone and not by Yahoo!, and that such license does not restrict recipients from exercising rights in the source code to the Software granted by Yahoo! under this Agreement or rights in the source code to any Modification granted by You as described in Section 1.3.\n\n      1.5 - This Agreement does not limit Your right to distribute files that are entirely Your own work (i.e., which do not incorporate any portion of the Software and are not Modifications) under any terms You choose.\n\n   2. Support\n\n   Yahoo! has no obligation to provide technical support or updates to You. Nothing in this Agreement requires Yahoo! to enter into any license with You for any other edition of the Software.\n\n   3.

If you do not agree with these terms, please remove the Product from your system. By incorporating the Product in your work or distributing the Product to others you implicitly agree to these license terms.\n\nStatement Of Copyright\n\nThe Product is, and remains, Copyright ® 1991-2000 iMatix Corporation, with exception of specific copyrights as noted in the individual source files.\n\nConditions Of Use\n\n   You do not need to provide the source code for the Product as part of your product. However, you must do one of these things to comply with the Product License Agreement:\n\n      1. Provide the source code for Product modules that you use, or\n\n      2. Make your product freely available according to a license similar to the GNU General Public License, or the Perl Artistic License, or\n\n      3. Add this phrase to the documentation for your product: \"This product uses parts of the iMatix SFL, Copyright ® 1991-2000 iMatix Corporation \u003chttp://www.imatix.com\u003e\".\n\nRights Of Usage\n\n   You may freely and at no cost use the Product in any project, commercial, academic, military, or private, so long as you respect the License Agreement. The License Agreement does not affect any software except the Product. In particular, any application that uses the Product does not itself fall under the License Agreement.\n\n   You may modify any part of the Product, including sources and documentation, except this License Agreement, which you may not modify.\n\n   You must clearly indicate any modifications at the start of each source file. The user of any modified Product code must know that the source file is not original.\n\n   \n\n   At your discretion, you may rewrite or reuse any part of the Product so that your derived code is not obviously part of the Product. This derived code does not fall under the Product License Agreement directly, but you must include a credit at the start of each source file indicating the original authorship and source of the code, and a statement of copyright as follows:\n\n   \"Parts copyright (c) 1991-2000 iMatix Corporation.\"\n\nRights Of Distribution\n\n   You may freely distribute the Product, or any subset of the Product, by any means. The License, in the form of the file called \"LICENSE.TXT\" must accompany any such distribution.\n\n   You may charge a fee for distributing the Product, for providing a warranty on the Product, for making modifications to the Product, or for any other service provided in relation to the Product. You are not required to ask our permission for any of these activities.\n\n   At no time will iMatix associate itself with any distribution of the Product except that supplied from the Internet site http://www.imatix.com.\n\nDisclaimer Of Warranty\n\n   The Product is provided as free software, in the hope that it will be useful. It is provided \"as-is\", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Product is with you. Should the Product prove defective, the full cost of repair, servicing, or correction lies with you.",

Note that I am excluding the 2.2.* line; using that would only create confusion. Naming the next release 2.3.0 would put to rest the confusion about 2.2.1 and 2.1.8.*.",

It applies to a given file (the \"Runtime Library\") that bears a notice placed by the copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along with this Exception.\n\nWhen you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this Exception.\n\n   0. Definitions.\n\n   A file is an \"Independent Module\" if it either requires the Runtime Library for execution after a Compilation Process, or makes use of an interface provided by the Runtime Library, but is not otherwise based on the Runtime Library.\n\n   \"GCC\" means a version of the GNU Compiler Collection, with or without modifications, governed by version 3 (or a specified later version) of the GNU General Public License (GPL) with the option of using any subsequent versions published by the FSF.\n\n   \"GPL-compatible Software\" is software whose conditions of propagation, modification and use would permit combination with GCC in accord with the license of GCC.\n\n   \"Target Code\" refers to output from any compiler for a real or virtual target processor architecture, in executable form or suitable for input to an assembler, loader, linker and/or execution phase. Notwithstanding that, Target Code does not include data in any format that is used as a compiler intermediate representation, or used for producing a compiler intermediate representation.\n\n   The \"Compilation Process\" transforms code entirely represented in non-intermediate languages designed for human-written code, and/or in Java Virtual Machine byte code, into Target Code. Thus, for example, use of source code generators and preprocessors need not be considered part of the Compilation Process, since the Compilation Process can be understood as starting with the output of the generators or preprocessors.\n\n   A Compilation Process is \"Eligible\" if it is done using GCC, alone or with other GPL-compatible software, or if it is done without using any work based on GCC. For example, using non-GPL-compatible Software to optimize any GCC intermediate representations would not qualify as an Eligible Compilation Process.\n\n   1. Grant of Additional Permission.\n\n   You have permission to propagate a work of Target Code formed by combining the Runtime Library with Independent Modules, even if such propagation would otherwise violate the terms of GPLv3, provided that all Target Code was generated by Eligible Compilation Processes. You may then convey such a combination under terms of your choice, consistent with the licensing of the Independent Modules.\n\n   2. No Weakening of GCC Copyleft.\n\nThe availability of this Exception does not imply any general presumption that third-party software is unaffected by the copyleft requirements of the license of GCC.",
